Cloning an Existing Repository
If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository—for example, a project you’d like to 
contribute to—the command you need is git clone. If you’re familiar with other VCS sys-
tems such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is clone and not checkout. This is 
an important distinction—Git receives a copy of nearly all data that the server has.
